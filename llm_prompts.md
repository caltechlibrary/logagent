I need a TypeScript program, `loganalyst.ts`, that runs under Deno 2.2. The program will read a log file generated by NginX. It will identify the items that end on the URL path `/file` and display a list of total log entries, frequency over time period the requests and the IP address and Agent strings with there assocated counts for the path.

Use this function this function for reading log lines.

```
export async function readLines(): Promise<string[]> {
  const lines: string[] = [];
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  const reader = Deno.stdin.readable.getReader();
  let done = false;

  while (!done) {
    const { value, done: readerDone } = await reader.read();
    done = readerDone;
    if (value) {
      const text = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
      lines.push(...text.split('\n').filter(line => line.trim() !== ''));
    }
  }

  return lines;
}
```

---

I need a `readlines_test.ts` script to test `readlines.ts` and the imported `readLines` function. Use `Deno.test`. Import assertions from `@std/assert`. Here's an example of the assertion import line.

```typescript
import { assertArrayIncludes, assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
```

---

Running `deno check readlines_test.ts` I get the following error, can you fix it?

```
Check file:///Users/rsdoiel/src/github.com/caltechlibrary/logagent/readlines_test.ts
TS2540 [ERROR]: Cannot assign to 'stdin' because it is a read-only property.
    Deno.stdin = new ReadableStream({
         ~~~~~
    at file:///Users/rsdoiel/src/github.com/caltechlibrary/logagent/readlines_test.ts:12:10
```

---

Update `loganalyst.ts` to use these revisions.

---

`loganalyst.ts` will be run as a command line program. Use `@std/cli/parse-args` to process the command line parameters. It should have a `-h`, `--help` option that displays a man page structured help text formatted as Markdown. 

---

The line `import { parseArgs } from "https://deno.land/std@0.198.0/cli/parse_args.ts";` should be `import { parseArgs } from "@std/cli/parse-args";`

---

In `readlines.ts` add an exported function called `processLines`, will take two parameters. The first is an input stream and the second is a function that will process the line. Include tests in `readlines_test.ts`.

---

Update `loganalyst.ts` to use `processLines` instead of `readLines` function. Include a command line option, `--verbose`, that will display the lines as they are being processed.

---

You have a regression, the line `import { parseArgs } from "https://deno.land/std@0.198.0/cli/parse_args.ts";` should be `import { parseArgs } from "@std/cli/parse-args";`.

---

The command line processing should happen inside a function called `main`. The `main` function should only run if `import.meta.main` is `true`.

---

The function `analyzeLogs` should be exported. It should have a second optional parameter that is a regular expression. If present then the `fileRegex` should use that value otherwise is should use the default `/.*\/file\s+HTTP\/\d\.\d"/`.

The regular expression needs to be definable from the command line using the option `-r` or `--regexp`.

---

Running `deno run loganalyst.ts -r '\*.zip' < test.log` yields this error for processing the regex.

```
error: Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /*.zip/: Nothing to repeat
    const customRegex = args.r || args.regexp ? new RegExp(args.r || args.regexp) : undefined;
                                                ^

    at file:///Users/rsdoiel/src/github.com/caltechlibrary/logagent/loganalyst.ts:101:3
```

---

`loganalyst.ts` should provide an option to summerize the data, only show specific analysis like the user agent strings and counts, the path and counts, the ip address and counts and frequency of request for unique paths over broken down by time ranges. There should be an analysis function that returns number of requests for each hour. These need to be selected from the command line as options and reflected in the help text.

Each analysis type should be implemented as an exported function so that additional analysis functions be added later.

The summary analysis should be the default analysis.   The summary analysis to return an object that includes output of each of the analysis functions.

There needs to be an option to output the analysis in JSON, YAML and CSV. The default output is JSON.

---

Instead of `import * as yaml from "https://deno.land/std@0.198.0/encoding/yaml.ts";` use `import * as yaml from "@std/yaml";`

---

Something isn't working correctly. If you use the option `--ips` you should only see the results of the ip address analysis.  If the `--yaml` you should see YAML encoded output. Right now you also see the JSON for `AnalysisResults` that has empty content.

---

Provide a `loganalyst_test.ts` test file for `loganalyst.ts` that uses `Deno.test` and the assertions imported from `@std/assert`. 

---

The following tests are failing, can you fix `loganalyst.ts`?

```

Notice that the value returned for "01/Jan/2023:00" is the total for both hours. The result must be shown for each hour that has data.

`LogEntry` interface attrtibute `timestamp` needs to be a `Date` object. `analyzeLogs` function needs to use `Date.parse` when populating the `LogEntry` object.

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to reflect the changes to `LogEntry`.

---

That did not change the test result.

---

The function `analyzeTimePeriodCounts` should group the counts based on the year, month, day and hour expressed like `2024-03-25T13`.

---

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to the new version of `analyzeTimePeriodCounts`.

---

In `loganalyst.ts` the `analyzeLogs` function should have paramaters for both input and output streams.

In the `main` function the input stream passed to `analyzeLogs` should be standard input and output stream should be standard output.

---

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to use the revised `analyzeLogs`.

---

In `analyzeLogs`, treat timestamp as a string rather than a `Date` object. If the timestamp was `01/Jan/2023:00:00:01 +0000` the period would be that string truncated to `01/Jan/2023:00`.

---

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to use the revised `analyzeLogs`.

---

Make the regular expression filter optional. If `--regexp` is passed onthe command then apply a regular expression otherwise do not filter the log entry out.

---

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to use the revised behavoir.

---

In `loganalyst.ts` the output to of the time period analysis has a trailing `:` that should not be there. This is causing `loganalyst_test.ts` to fail.

---

In `loganalyst.ts` function `analyzeLog` make the parsing of a log line an exported function that returns a `LogEntry` object.

---

Add tests for `parseLogLine` in `loganalyst_test.ts`.

---

Add a test of for `parseLogLine` and verify it can parse the following log entries.

In `loganalyst.ts` add an end point analyser function, `endPointAnalyser`, should report on the unique pathes requested, the  methods and their counts.

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to test the new `endPointAnalyser`.

---

Add a command line option to `loganalyst.ts` for selecting just the end point analysis. Update the helptext to include an example.

---

The `LogEntry` interface should have a `method` attribute corresponding to the HTTP method record in the log file.

Update `loganalyst_test.ts` to test for this new attribute.

--

When parsing a log entry the agent string should be saved in the `LogEntry` object without quotes. Similarly the quoted method and path should be unquoted before their values are assigned to the `LogEntry` object.
